# Udacity Project: 
# Front End Web Developer Nanodegree - Capstone Project: Travel Planner Web App

# Overview

This is a single page web app, which includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast.

It works by getting a desired trip location and date from the user, then displaying weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.
